It hums, crackles, and I think I'm having problems with my equipment.  As soon as I use any of my other cords then the problem is gone.  Hosa makes some other products that have good value.  But based on my experience I don't recommend this one.
I'm a pro-cheapo and I hated this thing. They're noisy, and the cables feel really cheap, gummy-like. Drop few more bucks and get something else!
Received it in time, standard blister packaging but the cable stopped working after 45 days. Since I was out of 30 days return time, sent an email to the manufacturer but no response till today.
These things are terrible. One wouldn't fit in my soundboard, another wouldn't lock in my mic. Plain and simple....if your looking for crap that doesn't work....buy this.
This is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says, it distorts, You want something to make your guitar sound like junk, this will do it. Why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me. This is not a boutique Distortion pedal like Hendrix would use. Boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.These things are built with heavy metal, it should last, I kinda hope it doesn't(just kidding), you want distortion, you got distortion
Here's the deal with this pedal. It is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money. In my opinion, for spending less than $100 for a distortion pedal, whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal, a few more bucks will get you the MXR Badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it.
These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG. All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars. I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out. Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place. Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller:1- Bulky. They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!2- Problems engaging. I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. It wasn't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- Cheap. They just feel cheap. Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.For a few bucks more I'll stick with Schaller's. I have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail.
I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed).
wind screen is way too big its bulky and to me useless, the screen came out, was thinking of glueing it back in but went to ebay and bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper that is MUCH better...avoid this!!
I got this for my Boss Loop Station, but it doesn't work very well.  I keep hoping I'll find something it DOES work well with...
Long story short, this string set has a strong metallic character, which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. Many people might like it, but for me, absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar, so by its nature it sounds mellow, warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out, I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position, WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes, it is that bad, you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls...Bottom line, I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. If you have guitars like seagulls or so, definitely avoid this string.
another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase.
This product is not what it seems. It has a cool name, but that's about it. It's a tool oil that stinks. I tried my best to get use to this product, but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret, my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. I now use Old English and my guitars thank me, my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. You will too...
It just randomly pops off my bass, it's so slick that when you let go it the neck just goes straight down. I hate it.
Years ago I used the Clayton &#34;small teardrop&#34; picks. I couldn't tell from the picture, that these were full size, and I didn't check the size in the description.  I still had a few of the small ones, so I used them as templates, to cut these down. I would have rated them higher, if I could have used them as is. It's my own fault for not looking at the specifications. I purchased two six packs of Clayton Teardrop picks, but found Dunlop 423R60 0.60mm (Orange) Tortex Small Tear Drop Guitar Picks, 36-Pack which are a lot cheaper.
Total flimsy junk. It leans WAYYY too far back. I'll be damned if I put my $1000 guitars on these things. On the other hand, ChromaCast makes one that's very close to this price, and I doubt that it could have been more for the money I paid.In summary... DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK.
...for something, but not a guitar.  Wasn't sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook, or notepad computer, so I can follow a recipe.  It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far, and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However, animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely, and in reality, it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner.
I bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone I was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. Installed as usual and tuned them. They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. My capo could not even hold them. I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it. I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. Use at your own risk!!!!!!! I personally wouldn't give a nickel for them.
This is an update to my original review because I have now fully tested two of these capos.  I'm truly surprised by all the good reviews here.  I'm not sure how it's possible.  I've already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim Dunlop capos.  I had purchased two, which I have now given away to student players as I cannot use them.  I tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar.  The E string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring. Both capos had this very same problem.When I received these capos, I noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual Jim Dunlop capos.  The craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official Jim Dunlop capos.  The rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product.  As a professional musician, I need to purchase reputable brand-name products because I can't afford to have my gear failing during performances.  I have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand, and no measurable reputation.  When I contacted the seller, they were not honest with me.
I know many people love the design, but I find it much too frustrating. You have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly, then snap it in, then turn and turn the screw, oops don't let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw. Then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again. What a farce. This is the worst capo I've owned, and I've tried nearly every brand and type. Yeah, I've had people show me how to do it right, and I know to do it right. It's just wrong to have to spend so much time slipping it on, snapping it, screwing it in, screwing it off, having it fall off, forget it, it's garbage to me. Also, while I'm getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day, the last thing I want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw. It's actually slightly painful to the fingers (momentarily, but why have to deal with that??) to work with. This design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it. The only good thing I can say about it is looks durable.No thanks.
I bought this hoping to use as intended, angled into guitar & straight into mixer, wrong, have to use it the other way around ... sad!
Only Lasted 2yr.  I have a lot of cheaper cables that get more use/abuse than this one that have outlasted it.
Could not get to fit small sound hole. Once in sound hole pickup did not work at all. Would not buy it.
I've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting.  This one is the worst.  The plastic screw (yes, plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to, is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle.  Bad...just bad.Secondly, there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp.  It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement.  After twisting on it twice I stripped it out.  Now the thing is worthless.  I'm returning it ASAP.I would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Nady 6" pop filter.  If you don't, you'll wish you did.
Its poorly made with attention to detail. I ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at Amazon. But they will not screw down all the way and are losse. It is useless!!! Other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine.
Just assembly for a try, only few rolls with music, it's had some hole on head, that's mean bad quality. buyer beware for this kind of.
CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again
this piece of plastic is just terrible.  you'd be better off with a couple of books and a towel.not recommended!
Go build your own. Build it to your specs and have a solid stand. If not, you can find a lot better head stands. This one was a huge disappointment. Does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick. Im back with my wood block and am happy.
I might have done something wrong...I read in a review that these hold six picks.It held three real well but on the fourth insert the thing just fell apart...I'll just keep using my pockets.
Man, this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks! DO NOT BUY - it is a wast of money... ug!
I use Clayton 1.26mm picks, a heavy pick but certainly not oversized. My picks don't fit!!! If I shove them in, I can't get them out. Also, this thing is huge for the back of the neck.
Dont last but a couple weeks..terrible feed back as the ends near the plugs detirorate quickly. Will never buy again even if only 5 bucks
Second one I bought. Lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months. Went through two of these before I learned my lesson. Don't waste your money on this junk. I love Planet Waves stuff normally, but these are junk.
I got a couple of these....only buy this cable if there is NO CHANCE that it will be ever used in the real world....after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug....and of course , since this cord is molded/sealed up tight , it can't be repaired.......you could cut off the plug and solder a good 1/4 inch plug on it...but why bother.?....just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord....this cord is too flimsy......its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug  housing...but inside its junk....thrown away money.!!!.......buy a lottery scratch off instead,,,
Well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks.  Bought a new Fender Mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago.  Last night amp would turn on but wasn't putting out any sound from the guitar. Messed around a bit and it started to work.  Today same thing and it's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp.  Thought I had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn't very happy.  Got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either.  At least my new amp is working and I only have to replace a $12 cord.Maybe I'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if I bought it at a local store I'd return it.  Not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund.  Will just move on to another company's cord.
The cable died on me in less than a month. Very disappointed in built quality.
I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists. I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect. These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics. They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable. It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. Perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-)
This arrived and when I tried to use it, it turned out that the male threads were some  oddball metric size that does NOT fit any standard adapter.Instead, these theads stripped the fitting on my mike clip, so now I have to go somewhere else and buy a new gooseneck AND a clip.This is such a standard item, that there is no excuse for making it with non-standard threads, and NO excuse at all for advertising it as standard 5/8ths...
I have several MXR pedals. Every one is superb--except for this PHASE 90 (the non-"script" version reviewed here). This PHASE 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean, for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion, a swoosh of sonic dirt. I did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal's distortion suggest some modifications. (Look up "MXR Phase 90 Mods," and "Erik's Corner" will show you how.) I made the "R28," "C11," and "C12" modifications. The result: a slightly improved phaser, one that still churned out plenty of distortion. Finally, I tried adjusting the internal trim pot. On no setting could I get rid of ... you guessed it: distortion. I spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable. No luck. BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU WANT A PHASER THAT DOESN'T ADD SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION, AVOID THIS INCARNATION OF THE PHASE 90.
Okay,  Color coding is a GREAT idea.Divas will not use the red ball windscreen.Why?Because, from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose.No kidding!  I have had several tell this to me and my sound tech.  So save your dough, buy any color but RED.Diva's!!!!  What can I say?
yes you can tweak it so its less, but cant even use it for recording with or without an amp so much hiss its unusable.
Do NOT use these to polish your guitar. It leaves tons of small fibers all over, and is hard to clean up. A total disaster. These are good for maybe wiping up dog poop, but not cleaning anything.
If you are looking for a 100% leather mandolin strap, consider another strap.  The outside surface of the Planet Waves strap is leather but the inside surface is some kind of man-made material glued to the thin leather part.  I will be ordering the Levys "Leather Mandolin Strap (Walnut)".
I bought this to replace a cord I was using to practice my guitar. My first cheap cord wasn't actually broken, but I didn't want any down time, so I had this just sitting there as a replacement. Fast forward some time, and I just wanted to try it out. Even though my cheap cord was still working fine, I really wanted to just try out the new cord.I really wish I had done that in the first 30 days. This cord did not work right at all. It seems like there is a short in it somewhere. I had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. Of course since it is for guitar, it falls almost immediately out of place again. So, I am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed, unlike this brand new bad cable.
The small e-string and the g- string both broke on the ball end while tuning.  I haven't broke a string while tuning in 20 years, never ever had one break on the ball end.Luckily I bought the three pack.But I can't recommend this product.
I thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings, they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret.
Based upon some of the other reviews, I feel I got a different product, as it didn't fit the descriptions given by others. I ordered two of these, and both were very thin material, not sturdy at all. Second, both straps were not adjustable to 59&#34;. Both mine measured 45&#34; from strap button hole to strap button hole, fully-extended. They are useless to me, as my guitar, a dreadnought, covers the middle of my chest when I put it on. I believe I was given a substitute product, since when I ordered these straps, the price was just $1.00, and now they're back up to $4.95 as I write this. I'm really sick of these Amazon substitutions. For what I paid, I won't bother returning them...not worth the hassle. I will donate them to a local music teacher who has students with smaller guitars. Very disappointed. Warning...if you see a price drop below $4.95, don't buy...it's probably not the product that's described here.
I really wanted this to work, but it doesn't.  Don't bother,it doesn't mute the strings at all.  One star, just for it getting here on time.
I bought a Glaesel Bridge & this Glaesel rubber mute together. I bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews. The mute fits the bridge fine, but compared to a brass mute (which of course works VERY well) this mute seems to do absolutely nothing. There is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on. Also, the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises.If You want or need a mute for practicing quietly (as many of us do), I suggest you buy something else. This item does not work and is a total waste of money. I tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new Electric Violin bought here on Amazon (FYI, that cheap little electric violin is an awesome & fun item! *Just make sure you buyThe Original Peg Drops by Ardsley& aGlaesel Self-Adjusting 4/4 Violin Bridge Mediumwith it!).I consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all. It does *not* mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way.
Pedal is not working, it just making noise. Poor quality control.Actually it looks like used pedal, not like new.Don't recommend this product.
I purchased this as an extra CV controller for a Digitech Control 2. When I got it, I tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and YES it does suck the tone right out of the signal. As far as a CV controler? it sucks at that too! Why? it squeaks as you move it (after 5 minutes use, right out of the box). Behringer is a joke and gives German engineering a bad name (although only 'conceived' in Germany).It's a direct copy of the Yamaha FC9 and so I am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares. I'm betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it.Also, you may say "who cares if it squeaks a little"? well I do when I am controlling volume swells or a 'wah' effect at low volume in the studio!Good luck if you buy it.
Pretty disappointed in the color. As the review title indicates, what I received is more of a 'black chrome' or dingy stainless color. These are simply not going to work with the MOTS pickguard I purchased them for. Perhaps they would blend in better on a black, black pearl or tort pickguard.I ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result. Perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is 'bad'. Some are very dull looking. Very disappointing, really.
I can't believe these were actually sent to me. The heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened. They come from Taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to China. I am sending them back. There is no way I would use these. Any screw you get from Home Depot would work better and look more attractive. I am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from Fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost.
This pickguard was used. It not only was missing the protective plastic but it actually was scratched from being on a guitar before.
Bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat. Doesn't fit perfect. Kinda bummed but oh well
Need 2 volume knobs and 1 tone, so for the price (and in the past) I have always purchased 2 packs together with no issues, however recently I needed and ordered some and I found out of 4 sets, no consistency in quality... example the lettering is thinner on some than others within the same set and between sets of the same item#. Also some had bright white lettering and others did not (but where not vintage lettering either). Guess these are too cheap for Fender to have QC on.Will try other brands next time.
Unless you guys are receiving something I am not, how can you give this anything more than one star. My backplate is so thin and cut so close to the screws that you can actually see were the route begins on the back of my Fender stratocaster. This is inexcusable. All the other Fender backplates I have have enough lip to cover the route, but not this mint green one. I simply cannot understand what Fender is thinking.  I am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from Fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost.
these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings. these strings last 2 days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed, the high e and the b string tend to break before they even get tuned to pitch, Ernie Ball strings are garbage, the only time I will buy these is if it's the only thing available, most people like these because they are endorsed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage, and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than 2 days out of a set of strings, Touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set, and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh,  you can spend 4$ for a set of Ernie Ball or D'Addario every 2 days or you can spend $7 for a set of DR strings and change them once a month, or you can spend 10$ for a set of Elixir Polywebs and change your strings once every 3 months,  It doesn't make sense to use these crappy Ernie's unless you are sponsored by EB and have an endless supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars,
It is OK, but it does not compare to the ergo holder.Which you may find here:Dunlop Ergo Pickholder.The main problem with this pickholder is that it is very difficult to get your pick out, and it is extremely fragile.
I bought one of each Soft, Medium and Hard Wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right, the Hard is as soft as the Soft. They felt exactly the same in fact. The Medium was the hardest out of the bunch.Packaging error? I have no idea. The fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing. So check with what you get.Sound wise, the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar, making it sound really dull and muted.There is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that I do not think it is idea for strumming.The only reason I can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly, you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead.
These picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar. I don't like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups, etc. Big disappointment. I'm getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem. Back to the drawing board I go.
OK, it was cheap (nine bucks at the time), the design looked good and sensible, and it seemed a perfect solution to a real need. I bought it without hesitation. HOWEVER(!), once hooked up, I was very surprised how flimsy it is. I have a 13" gooseneck, a light condenser mic and small shock-mount on it. At the slightest movement of the mic stand this attachment flaps up and down like crazy and will continue this way for a something like a minute if not stopped by hand. Obviously, any small bump into the stand will once again set this off. Using it at home, I've gotten away with not touching the stand while recording by being very careful, but obviously this unit is far from ideal. Since then, I've gotten another sidemount boom from this same brand, and though I haven't really put through its paces yet, this other unit is rock solid and far more adjustable and reliable, AND only costs a few bucks more (On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom). For anyone considering this product, I HIGHLY recommend bypassing this one and forking out just a few more bucks for the On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom. You will be far far happier.Cheers!
I'm another reviewer who has, upon personal inspection, discovered that the rear leg of the stand is too short to provide staedy support for any beloved guitar. I returned it.I've &#34;First Act&#34; brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed.
This arrived with one end of the security strap and metal part...Broken! OK...I bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option...it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it!Obviously it was not the packaging which was more than adequate and there were no broken off pieces in the box.Of course,I could not recommend this product to anyone...most disappointing purchase!
They only fit if you have enough room in your strap button, if not they will just pop right out. I threw mine away.
I even called Dunlop to see if these lok strap systems would work for an electric acoustic.  The guy at Dunlop told me "oh yes, they have been specifically designed to work with electric acoustic".  That is NOT the case.  I purchased multiple units, and it will cost me more to return to Amazon than it's worth.  But basically I know have hunks of plastic that I could use to make a sculpture!Because of the bottom pin being the plug in for electric pick up, the thickness causes a problem and this plastic do hickey will not fit.If anyone out there has a solution for securing the strap, please reply to this feedback.What really frosts me is that I called Dunlop and apparently their customer service folks don't know their products well enough to be recommending product.  It's called, TRAIN your people!!!
Hard to believe this was so bad. I have a Planet Waves locking guitar strap, which is a dream, and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap. However, it is so thick that it can't really fit on a regular guitar strap pin with a strap, and when I tried to lock it, the two pieces came apart. Go with the Planet Waves Lock Straps.
I bought this because--hey, a wireless mic for $13? Why not? I *might* be able to use this in a public address system--the connections all work, and it makes sounds, but the static is unbearable no matter how much I fiddle with different, the adjustment screw in the receiver... nothing works. The audio is always clipped. Don't even think of using this for music.
Arrive, in trashed packing, but the worst was that it sounded like a piece of chalk on a blackboard... certainly NOT professional quality or any quality that I would give it.
Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.We tried to make the Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us.
Cheap crappy strap. It's too stiff, not comfortable at all. I regret purchasing this... Save your money, go hunt for a Coach strap or something similar. They are expensive but worth it.
I've two of these stands. On one of them, the base part of the tubing has lost its tack weld. If you carefully separate the pie slice shaped black foam from the base of the stand, you'll see that the base of the tubing is welded there. Mine lost its weld, so the tubing is not secure to the grey base - they separate - I was left holding the tubing while the grey base fell to the floor!UPDATE: 1/9/12 GLEN INGLES REFUSES TO REPLACE OR REPAIR THE STAND. BEWARE! ...and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in..............wait for it................China. That may explain why it failed, but Glen Ingles could have offered to replace it. I guess he doesn't want me to buy any more of his products, or refer others to his products. Well, that's his policy. That's okay, he's got competition, and I'll be purchasing from them instead.
My problem is that I am used to playing Hohner Golden Melody and Special 20 harps.  I guess I should have paid attention to the other 1 and 2 star ratings.  These harps have no volume.  Don't waste your money on them.  I guess the only thing worth having is the case, but the case has no handles or carry strap.5/25/14 - I said the case had no handle, well I take that back.  There is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat.  I was able to fold that little strap outwards and then zip the two zippers up to it.  With one finger I can carry the case with my quality harps inside.
Disappointing; was looking for to receiving these.But; mostly they are unplayable. Leak air badly. Easier learning bagpipes than these things.Save your money and get some harps that actually work.Decent case though.
Crikey, where to begin. Firstly, I hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet. Secondly, they mismarked one of the packets, so it appeared I had two &#34;D&#34; strings, instead of two &#34;E&#34; strings. Lastly, and certainly the least favorably, once tuned up, the strings sounded terrible! They were tinny and clangy sounding. I've never heard worse strings. Fortunately, I had bought a package of Ernie Ball Earthwood med. light, as well. I replaced the godawful Martins with the Ernie Ball's and they were far, far better! Shame on Martin for such a piss poor product. I'll never buy their strings again.
I am very disappointed. The guitar was packed with its strings tensioned and the top detachment partially from the guitar body.It is unusable until repaired.Update: It has been several days after writing and attach photographs to the seller (Amazon), and have not received any communication.
I wanted to like this. I really did. The idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think, &#34;Perfect&#34;. However, the unit I received was cr@p, and I'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions. The one I got kept cutting in and out. You might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75% of the notes or something. And when holding a chord, the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds. Frustrating.I did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit. The so-so sound and overall quality however didn't compel me to give it another go. Bummer. Any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability?Cheers
It doesn't seem to work. I think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesn't seem to absorb any water.
The sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously isn't going to last long.  Also, trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing.I'm going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it.
This thing is useless. Good idea, but way too light/rickety to be useful. Unless you're constantly aware of it, 99% of the time you'll end up just kicking it over when you go to put your foot on it. Pass on this.
I've had it for about a month now and it hasn't fallen apart so I guess that's a plus, but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective, as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore USELESS.  Thanks to this problem I am only able to use TWO slots out of TWELVE.  It's definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting, stay away from this.
It's really not a 200w system.  The booklet even says it is only 100 watts, and I doubt it is really even that powerful.  The wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it.  My Shure XLR wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug.  The instrument input works OK with my Taylor guitar, but it's not 100 watts loud.  I guess it's OK as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals.
I have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly, I have had enough.The main problem with this tuner is the usability.The tuner has a poor display, is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key.Tuning with it can be condensed into one word - frustrating.The needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever I pick the strings, especially so when the guitar is much out of tune.The poor display is dark, with no build-in light, and has poor visibility at angles too. Combine all that you have a terrible, accurate tuner.Yes, it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display, which is +/-2 cents.Enough said, I bought a new tuner, the Seiko SAT800, for a bit more money that this.The main differences between SAT800 and the CA-40:SAT800 has a build-in light, CA-40 does not.CA-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle, SAT800 does not.SAT800 has a auto and manual mode, CA-40 has auto.SAT800 displays the octave of the note, e.g. 1E, 2E, etc, CA-40 displays only displays the alphabet, E for all oactaves.SAT800 has a numerical display for the cents off, CA-40 does not.The needle graph on the Seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall.I wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner. I was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on Amazon and I hope you would not be.
This tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn't really work. As soon as I insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low B flat and stays there... Even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end. At first I thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this, I also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine. So again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input.
I've been very disappointed with this tuner. When I've used it the needle keeps jumping all the way to the right(sharp) then back to the left(flat). I have two(2) other tuners I bought from Wal-Mart and I always get accurate tunings from them.  I bought this KORG because it's a brand name and the Company has an outstanding reputation. Even though my tow(2) Wal-Mart tuners are older, they both still work better than this KORG.
There are better tuners out there. Far better. This could be good, but it seems to me that all Korg products seem to think of Standard tuning as the only tuning out there, and they don't even tune it well to Standard (especially when tuning the G string)! I personally play exclusively in Standard for my electric playing, but sometimes I want to fiddle around with open-tunings on an acoustic. This piece-of-junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using "F" or "C" notes. I have no clue as to why that is, pretty stupid if you ask me, especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d-bags (I say that with love) that play in open tunings. Trust me, your money is best spent elsewhere.
This would have been a nice slide if I could get it on my finger.  I'm borderline skinny and it still won't fit.  Save your money unless your under 10 years old.
Lets face it, in general string winders are pretty much all the same right? WRONG! I went with this one because I trusted the Dunlop name. What a let down. on the second guitar I used it on the handle and the head separated, sure you can press it back together, but after separating several times on every string, it gets a little old....quick. Already ordered a different one to replace it. One thing I cant stand is inferior tools.
Ok its cheap. You knew that when you bought it. I really thought it was going to be more then one since it said assorted and showed a few in the picture. It was only one and it was red. Broke with first use.
This strap is uncomfortable and too flimsy to feel good, also doesn't fit an instrument where there's no place to hook it .  I returned mine, as it just didn't fit well for my uke or mandolin.
Sorry Fender...this one is just a waste of money.  Get something better that doesn't twist up an ravel into knots.
This pedal, in short, sucks.  There's no point to having an A/B pedal if it adds a huge amount of hiss to your sound. Behringer needs to go back to the drawing board with this.
It's a decent unit, but stopped working completely after about 6 months. Tried everything I could, but it's gone. I would not recommend this pedal.
Behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light, cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging. I just didn't want to spend $100 on the Boss version, but you get what you pay for! Another thing that I hate is it's really hard to change the battery, unlike the Boss pedals. save your money and steer clear of this one. I also bought a Behringer power amp for $200 that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out.
Bought this because of all the great reviews, ButThis doesn't work, just like the last Beringer product I bought. Will I ever learn? Very disappointing.UPDATE- Now working; got my mate an Aussie genius to have a look.Found pedal wasn't engaging when pushed down.Took plastic cover off and pressed black button with his pinky and light came on; sheer genius.Worked fine with cover off; then replaced cover with new bit of rubber. And it still works.Amazing sound actuallyStill not sold on Berhinger though
Ok I understand it now - I use Abelton Live 8 and thought this would be and easy, read cheap, interface to record some instruments with. WRONG! I am returning it. It does not work, has no drivers and is not detected on my Mac (my Mac finds everything). Bought the Focusrite unit instead. Got it to work on garage band but latency was miserable and so was hiss on recordings. Save your money and time. Buy the Focusrite interface or one of the others. Yes over $100 but you either want feedback, hiss and frustration or you want a smooth interface connection with good resonance. It also lacks 1/4 plug, one rca input, you need an addapter. Not what I thought I was getting - dumb me.
Not very bright. Not very flexible. Too big. Clunky. I really don't like it. I wish I had went in a different direction.
They say 2-4 months, I've never come close to even a month. Usually 3 weeks and they are toast in a guitar case not opened more than twice in that 3 weeks.  If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.  I don't recommend these.
I bought this pedal new, hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage.  I knew going in that it would not sound like a Martin D-28, but I thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars.Imagine my profound disappointment.Really, Boss??? This is by far the worst pedal I have ever used of yours.  This thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the "Top" control higher than about 9 o'clock.  At first I thought I must have a defective unit, but then I started reading reviews on-line.  Seems like it is part of the design. It's too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones, hidden beneath a wall of fizz. Totally unusable, as far as I'm concerned. By the way, I tested it direct to a PA as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar (strat).
I bought this pedal as a companion to my Roland AC-33 Acoustic Amp.  The pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy.  However you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate.  This is totally unnecessary for a foot-switch.  The worst part is the leads on the battery connector (9 volt) were not properly soldered or had shorted out.  The only way I could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made.  For the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed (i.e. all that has to work are two switches and a battery) you would think that Boss would put out a better product.  I also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close, leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question.  I would HIGHLY recommend that you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site.
Sadly, I can't review the mic itself nor the cable that comes with the mic as they were both non-responsive.  I tried the mic with other cables I have lying around that I know work, and I got nothing; it was like the mic wasn't plugged in at all.  And the cable included in this pack, well, the plastic (not metal) connector to the mic was cracked.  I still tried it with a difference mic... static.I can't blame Amazon for the broken bits as the whole thing was packed well and the box did not appear damaged.The stand that comes with this set up seems really good for the price of the whole package.  I was impressed at how much of is *isn't* plastic.Still... I can't recommend this product.
DOA...no good, out of the box,plug it, nothing.....no way to send it back (I`m not from the States)....meaning...I just wasted away $40 something bucks (add shipping)....I did bought a Behringer pedal before (Tremolo/Pan) with good results, but I guess there`s two sides to this particular low economy pedals....Well, I`ll man up and buy something else...
It sounds very artificial, I remember first getting this pedal and really loving the sound and kick it had, now that I use it with a better amp, it sounds very processed and artificial in sound that it's not even worth the price I payed for it before. I also had bought another one to replace the first one because the input section jack got messed up in the amp that it didn't want to lock with my guitar cable and when I took it apart, there was no way for me to fix it other than sending it to be replaced. Shitty pedal.
ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home "12/23/11" and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset, i would not returned because i don't feel like fighting with no body but they shouldn't do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for.
It was Not what I wanted. When A Person has a low Income We can Not afford what We can Not use. I was looking for what Is called Shimmer most Reverbs do Not have Shimmer as the RV600 Because Digitech called Shimmer, String Swell and Volume Swell Is linked to the Violin Sound It cost Me 30.00 Its called Slow Motion for a reason because It has to be played slow to hear the effect the only way to hear It Is with Over Drive being played on the high Strings. It might be good for playing with a Bow, I have No Idea because I can Not afford a Bow.
I just got this and I've noticed that it when I activate the pedal it sucks almost all of the bottom end out of my tone... I have a crybaby that doesn't have the range the 847 does but its 10x's more transparent.  There may be other factors at play here as it is new, but the lesson is: try it before you just buy it to make sure it works for you.
garbage if you like it...then buy it.this is NOT how the world of music sounds.TOO MUCH BASS and other garbage...are you guys really HEARING anything ?world has gone bass crazy since about 1981...more and more..we lost analog, we lost quality thanks tocompression and mp3, and now to put morecrap into our ears, they give you ONEfrequency...bass ONLY , take it or leave it.will go find REal headphones, thanks.kb
If you want to use this to power up a Tascam DR series digital recorder, I have a less expensive solution for you:  if you own a usb wall charger (like a cell phone charger), you can use that to power your device through its usb port. That's a lot cheaper than spending twenty-something dollars on an additional wall wart!
I purchased this after reading many favorable reviews online and it seemed like a good unit for the price. After trying to use it I promptly returned it. I do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows.  I have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer.  I tried recording on the H2 using it's line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my Mackie sound board or my stereo receiver.  No matter how I set the levels the recording on the H2 was very distorted.  I played with the record levels and the AGC and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal.  I have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean, good quality sound.  The problem with my H2 was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal, which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp. Recording from the internal mics seems to work fine.  I have worked with professional sound equipment for over 25 years and the Zoom recorders are the only brand where I have found this problem.The H2 has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings, look for something else.  I exchanged this model for an H4n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal, but not as bad as the H2.  I finally ended up getting the Tascam DR-07 which I am very happy with.  It has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder.
the cables are great for the price cant go wrong I have not used them for a long time but so far no problems i ordered 6 more cables.don't buy this cables they keep failing, cheap material with WHAT I SPENT ON THEM YOU COULD BUY A COUPLE DECENT ONES
Be careful; I have a small recording studio, so we put our cables through a lot, and these guys just don't last. They were fine for the first few months, but then they started to die like a murder mystery. Seriously, one after another they would just go, for no apparent reason.Fine one second, and then it would just go horribly staticky. I actually had two blow at one time, and thought my PA was shot. Thankfully, it was just these cables. NOT GOOD. Spend a little extra on another brand. These have been my favorite:GLS Audio 25ft Cable Cords
i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people.  The strap is about 6" too short for my Seagull S6 guitar.  I will say the build quality is great but too short, is and remains, too short.  I will keep this item and take it to a shoe shop or saddle repair place and have and extendo put into the strap.  I just can't understand how they can sell this a a guitar strap when it is clearly too short.2/22/2013 I fired off an email to LEVY and the long and "short" of all this is you will have to fork over another $30 to buy an extendo for this strap. I don't quite understand why they don't make the strap long enough to start with other than the fact they can extract another $30 to make it work right in the first place.  here's a link to the extendo optionLEVY'S LEATHERS MMGXL-2.5-BRN STRAP EXTENDER http://www.amazon.com/LEVYS-LEATHERS-MMGXL-2-5-BRN-STRAP-EXTENDER/dp/B00BH5N91E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1361565768&sr;=8-2&keywords;=MMGXL-2.5  the irony here is I managed to buy the last one for the immediate future.This is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider. I got the extendo strap and it does not match the original so now I have this cobbled up looking guitar strap. It's sort of like wearing a suede shoe on one foot and a polished leather shoe on the other.  I will keep this strap but sure feel like I've been had on this purchase... the terms bait and switch come to my mind.
I have no idea what happened or if anyone else had this problem, but I got literally 8 plug-ins, and not the part where you can plug in an existing cable to make this into a chain. It's like I got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends. Soooo it's pretty much useless to me. I guess if you get one of those power blocks with 9v outlets on them, I guess you could plug this into it but I really see no point. I would've shipped it back I lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss. I think I payed like $8 for it so whatever. I would recommend going to an actual music store so you can physically see both the male ends and the female end.
I ordered this plug because it is advertised as a &#34;1 Spot&#34; brand plug. It is not what I received. Instead I received a generic plug  for eight 9v connections that would definitely fit the purpose, but a really cheap version. The plugs on this generic version are larger than the 1 Spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic. The original 1 Spot plug has much smaller plugs, great for saving space on a pedal board, and the wires are soft and &#34;rubbery&#34;, again making it easier to work with on a pedal board, specially if you're working with a pedal board like Pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars. I informed the seller about the issue and was told it was a mistake and that they would send me the correct one. In my email to them I included an image of the original packaging of the 1 Spot 8 Plug to make sure there would be no mistake, but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug. I emailed them again for a refund, which they promptly did. I can say, that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money. I imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original 1 Spot plug, wouldn't know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight 9v connectors. I strongly recommend, spend the extra two or three dollars and get the original 1 Spot 8 Plug.
the cable hisses, crackles and pops right out of the package.  save your money and buy a better cable.  i will buy cables locally from now on so i can easily return them if they are defective.  i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else.
As I've heard with the Pyle Pro amps, I received mine today, and it was defective. Only one channel worked, and it definitely looked like it took a beating before it arrived at my doorstep. The packaging was very good though, so I'm  thinking this looks like a refurb/used, and they listed it as new. Already printed the return shipping label, and it will head back to the Amazon warehouse on Monday...
This cover does not fit a full size acoustic/electric Hohner guitar.  I measured the whole at 3 7/8&#34;, but this cover does not even come close to fitting!  It measures 4 1/6&#34; in diameter, so check your guitar closely!
Doesn't reduce sound worth a darn.  I thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things.  Muddies it up a bit maybe, but not really a reduction in dB.
These speakers worked great for 14 months. Last week (4/8/13), one of them wouldn't power up all the way. The problem is getting worse every time I try to use them, and it's just a matter of time before it stops working.  It seems there is a problem with the capacitors that I did read about in a few reviews. I took a chance on the monitors anyway, and it was a huge mistake. I only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week. I contacted M-Audio's online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops. One on the East coast and one on be west coast. I've since found many complaints about this same issue all over the Internet and on the M-Audio support site. M-Audio doesn't stand behind their products, and I'll never purchase anything from them again.
Sound nice, but very unreliable BX5a Deluxe.I own a pair of YAMAHA NS 10s and EVENT 20-20s, and they are all currently working without problems with over 10 years use.2 years ago I purchased a set of regular BX5a's, and they lasted about 1 1/2 years, and then the faulty capacitors leaked.I just replaced them with the BX5a Deluxe model, and after only one week. one of the Internal amps will no longer power up.I need a pair of affordable AV shielded monitors that I can depend on, and these Cheap M-Audio Monitors are not it.I am back to using my 20-20's with slight AV noise until I find a decent AV shielded monitor.M-Audio was a much better company before Avid took them over!
In an attempt to see what's new in the pick industry, I decided to dive in and give these a go.  They are way too flimsy if, like me, you use a heavier pick.  I have always used Dunlop Tortex greens and these Davas just can't compete.  Not only were they too flimsy, but when I played with any aggression (heavy rock-based material), the picks would fly out of my hands.  This was a huge disappointment.
Unhappy with it, actually I already replaced them. The method of attachment is poorly designed, it doesn't matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls, the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions. Expensive locks too.
I had some issues with my 18-watt all tube amp so I experimented and replaced all the tubes.  Issues not only continued but worsened.  Hum, noise, volume fade, unwanted distortion at low volumes.  I eventually put back the original El84s and that didn't help.  Once I removed the Tung-Sol 12AX7 preamp tubes and replaced, the hum stopped, sound quality of the amp was consistent, quiet and back to par.  My experience with the Tung-Sol tubes was very, very negative.  They caused me to go out and buy another amp.  I had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast.  I'll never buy this brand again.
Don't buy this Chinese piece of crap if you really need a three guitar stand. It is barely workable for two.It is easy to set up, but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place. And you absolutely  have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floor/ground.The best thing these stands are built for are V Type guitars such as my Jackson Rhoads as long as you can put them back to back. For Les Paul and Strat type axes, their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow, stick like feet of the stand, especially when they are new. You can't tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet won't support enough weight to make that possible. So this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand. If you just gotta buy something from On Stage, get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it ends up being better balanced. But really, you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hang.This is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for.
This is a fantastic product that is well made. The plastic is heavy duty and comes with a plastic cover that must be removed before use. This ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition.The tool is extremely useful. I have just started playing with a band, and it is very common for band members to call out a song and the key that it is in. With the wheel, I immediately know what chords to choose from. I also know what notes are in each chord. In addition, it has a note by note image of the entire fretboard so that you can see where the roots are for the scale you are playing.The wheel is also invaluable for switching keys. For example, say you're playing the I, IV, and V chords in the key of C., but your lead singer is having trouble and would rather sing it in Bb. All you need to do is dial the wheel to Bb, find out the new I, IV, and V chords, and start playing. The wheel makes chord transposition a breeze.I feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair. This is a very useful product at a fair price.No, I am not affiliated with the company at all. I'm just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool.In my opinion, this is a five star product.
This capo isn't quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar. If I position it just so it will work as long as I don't bump it or a string will pop out of one side.
I bought one of these for a vintage Fender Showman that doesn't have built in reverb.  Put a battery in and plugged it in.  Very simple.  But the sound was horrible!  No setting delivered an effect that sounded anything like any kind of reverb I ever heard or would want to hear.  The closest I could get was a cheesy delay or echo effect that sounded awful.  On the other hand, the reverb from my Korg AX-100G (that I was using on another rig) was great.  Maybe my DR600 was not functioning properly, but I don't think so.  I think that's the way it really sounds.  So I got a return authorization from Amazon (very easy - never fails), put it back in the box and UPS picked it up the next day and I got a full refund.JM Tepper
Often, we get what we pay for. After researching various pieces of sound equipment for weeks and weeks, I chose solid items for reasonable prices.I should've known better to skimp on what is a critical piece of the puzzle - the quality of the cable. This item simply didn't ever work - it arrived with a bent pen on one end, and even when we attempted to straighten it, it didn't connect well onto the mixer board. The microphone end was a VERY shaky connection with the most intermittent power conveyed to the mic.Don't buy this item - spend the relatively small extra amount and get a more reliable brand.
If you're a metalhead, STAY AWAY!! I tried this on multiple metal pedals and the peavey Rogue G10 blows it out of the water. This thing sounds like CRAP with anything distortion. It's GREAT for jazzy blues and an ultra clean tone though or that classic fender crunch. But if you demand metal, get far away!
I tried with with my Macbook Pro with both Mountain Lion and Mavericks. Also with my Win7 x64 machine. I tried it with a variety of MIDI capable gear including trying to update firmware on FX hardware, sending and receiving MIDI PC and MIDI CC, as well as transmitting MIDI Clock in and out. I simply couldn't get this to work most of the time. Active Sense used on most Roland products seems to kill it completely.In contrast I purchased the -MU's Xmidi 1x1 Tab and it works flawlessly and without issue every time I use it.I should have totally returned this product. Instead it's in a landfill.
Doesn't wotk with V-Amp 3.  Doubt it works at all.  Red light always stays on and I've never seen the green light.
They have no grip at all they brake and ware out in a hour or so of hard playing there just junk for newbie that don`t know any beter but hey what do you expect they are made by D Addario get some real picks like Dunlop Tortex
I have a real problem with these patch cables.  I got them as a christmas gift but they don't stay in my pedals' input jacks without causing problems and having to push them in on occasion.  Most problematic is the connection between my EHX memory boy and digital memory man... never had problems with any other cables here, but these refuse to stay put without having to constantly adjust.
I thought it was my jack for a while, then I noticed it wouldn't stay in any pedal.  There is no "click" assuring that the cable is in place... and there's a reason for that, it isn't! Slips right out of every pedal I have.  Not reliable.
Bought it after read reviews. I had signal loss using these cables.. it's like having a loose connection inside the cable. My connections were on and off, I thought I had a dead pedal.. I have to wiggle and hold to get signal. It's too flexible almost like Twizzlers (no kidding!). If you want a cheap and reliable pedal cables, go get the one from Pro Co, I bought it very cheap from Sweetwater on Ebay, surprisingly very good quality and looks durable!
The Boss ME-70 is not as nice as the BOSS GT-10 and will not let you install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.  I recommend getting a BOSS GT-10 and then install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.  Now your guitar can sound like Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound with BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.  Search Google for BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.
As soon as I attached my mic, and with my strong hands, I over twisted the mic holder on the threads, and the thread piece came loose on the stand.  I think I can fix it with some liquid metal, but this is not as impressive as some mic stands I've had in the past.  Sincerely, DocAfter a few months of trying to make it work.  It doesn't.  I changed my rating from 3 to 1  This puppy is just poor quality.
I have three mic stands, with this one being the fourth. I STILL have three mic stands because this one was absolutely horrible.1. The top mount would rarely stay fixed and kept dipping down.2. The bottom clamp never did secure properly. It kept opening up even without a mic on it. The weight of the stand itself stripped it.I sent it back without hesitation.
I used to buy a lot of wire form these guys.... However, you need to be careful and test everything you get from them on an XLR cable tester.I didn't believe it myself...I read another reviewer had an issue with XLR cables being wired incorrectly from pin to pin. So I took my handy cable tester and went through about a dozen cables.I got through only 4 monoprice cables before I found one that was miss-wired. Now I will be checking all of them for sure.Not a good start though.Glad the other reviewer made that discovery and passed it on.I suggest everyone check their monorpice cables. The testers are very cheap and may show problems you weren't aware of.
The coversion cable didnt work. t is  axlr to UBS cable. I have the red  blinking light syndrome also. But I learned awhile back dont try to fix something you paid for Send it back. So izm Thanks HDE for wasting my time. Go sell your snake oil to someone else.........
These types of pedals are toys. They are a cheap way for a beginner to have effects to play with. By all means if you are buying it for your kid who just started playing. If not, i recommend slowly building your pedal collection and use the money to get 1 decent pedal whether it is a delay, or distortion.
I had a friend with one of these and he loves it. I got one on his recommendation and when I put the batteries in it, it started smoking. It did work for awhile. I pulled the batteries out and tried to AC adapter and it smoked again, this time it did not work. I am one of those people who gives an item one try and if it does not work, holds a grudge. I would not advise anybody to get this.
A loud hum will crescendo in every few minutes even if the ground is lifted.  Works great in intervals though, too bad those intervals are minutes.
It stopped working after 2 gigs. I'm not sure why, but it is very frustrating. I guess you get what you pay for here.
Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.We tried to make the Fender/Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us.
Unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage! I tune my hellraiser to d then drop to c and it will not register. the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes.
I was looking for a portable fold-up stand that I could take to gigs and searched around.  Found the Guardian at Amazon and thought for $10, how could I go wrong?  Oops! Wrong.  The stand is sturdy and folds up nicely, but I found it next to impossible to get my Fender Jazz bass to stand up in it.  The lack of an extended support for the neck means you have to try to balance the guitar very precisely against the apex of the stand and pray that no one gets near it or that the wind doesn't blow.  This is OK for a lightweight acoustic that you don't care too much about, but for for an electric guitar or bass, no way.I just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support.  Live and learn.
I have an Epiphone Les Paul and this stand does not hold it at all.  The holders are too far apart to keep the guitar from sliding through onto the floor.  Maybe it's a decent stand for an acoustic or a fatter electric.  But given that Les Paul is a pretty popular model of guitar, this should not be sold as an electric guitar stand.  I'm rating it for what it is sold as, and for that, it gets 1 star, and only because since there is no zero.
This product has almost zero documentation in the box or on the Akai Pro website.  Technical support is also almost zero.  Akai seems to not care about getting new users up to speed on their products.  Customer service is basically "If you have to ask, you should not buy this".  I asked the Akai technical department which sequencer software I needed and they told me to go to a Music store!  This may sound stupid but unless you have a lot of MIDI knowledge and experience don't buy this product.  Try finding a MIDI tutorial that is usable.  Good luck with that chore.Added 08Nov2010: The keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing.  I sent an email to Akai asking for a replacement but they do not have any parts.  I find that unbelievable.
The box contained a bag with just the bottom half of the stand. The top section with the mic thread attachment was missing. Sent it back and did not reorder.
The material used is fine.  The looks are fine.  The length is horrible.  This is too short for most adults that play guitar.  It felt like I was holding my guitar around my neck instead of off my shoulders.  I attached it by the longest way possible and it was well short of what I could use.  To me this was a worthless purchase.  I just tucked it into a drawer and it will sit there and not be used again.
I got a few of these as a Christmas gift and they're just bad.  I put them on my pedalboard where I previously had longer cables and these just didn't stay in the jack.  I have no other problems with these jacks with any other cable but these.  If I play loudly and my room vibrates a bit, the cable even works its way out of the jack a little bit and cuts my signal.  Awful.
So heres the thing that no one else wants to say. The thing is built like a piece of s***. It jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around. I used this 3 times and it shorted out. The lights started flashing and it got hot. I called line 6 and they determined it was bad so they opened a "ticket". FYI if you want to deal with the worst customer service in the industry just call line 6. Not only do they not know what they were talking about but in the backgrounc I could hear them lauging and joking like there was a big party going on. I wish I would have never bought this but hopefully I get  a new one soon. Well see how helpful they really are.
I have always loved line 6. This product sounded great for about an hour then total gave up. It went dead. I changed channels and it worked for like a minute then went dead. I am sorry to say that I returned it. My AKG wireless guitar bug has lasted years with no drop outs.I am really disappointed.
I was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived. Just to find out it WASN'T WORKING!!! it is defective, and because i brought it to Mexico, now i can't get a refund or a replacement.I will try to fix it through some local electrician or something. Very dissapointing!
One of the ball bearings designed to catch and lock the side mounted to the strap dislodged, and my very expensive Fender Custom Shop Telecaster fell flat on the ground.
Sounded good. Warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac15. I rocked all night and loved the sound. Next day i turned it on, my amp was crackling out and wiping out the signal i checked the tubes and one of them was making violent purple flashes before the signal burnt out. I then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well. I changed out the fuse and checked again and the tube was still doing the same thing so i just swapped the tubes back for atock. Id like to see a real set of jjs, im sure one of them was a dud.
I play harp with some some that I perform. I found that all of these Harmonica's the note's are off and it's hard to play, I have G Blues harp that I compared the G harp to and the notes were a little off. The C harp was terrible. That said the only thing I like about this order is the case. I going to see if I can return them for store credit.
Too thick, no flexibility. Sounds really harsh and like it is ruining my ukulele strings. Tried on bass too, again with less than satisactory results.
At the time I bought, was $16.  Mine arrived broken, so it had gone back.  Reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken.  Not upset about that - stuff happens.  It is just not a good stand.  Light construcion, unstable (topples easily) and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped.  The 'protective' materails on the stand to keep product from scratching your instrument are the soft, shiny runner like materail and it 'sticks' to my instrument's neck.  So I pick up uke and I get a stand until the stickiness is seprated by gravity.  Happened every time.  Yes, I tried out the stand even though broken, and it proved to be a bad choice.  Back it has gone.  5 stars to Amazon's return policy, thouh!
There is a problem with the design.  When you move the head, the 3 little plastic pieces that hold the ball that allows you to rotate the head, just break off.  The tuner itself is great, but the product fails because it broke in 5 minutes.
For some reason, this one just doesn't hit the notes right.  It looks like it should tune more precise than other models but the tone is way off for mine anyway.  I have tried it several times and it just doesn't tune right.  Then I recheck with my other brand and it's not even close.  Maybe I just got a bad one?  I like that this one shuts off automatically..but again, it's WAY off tune.I did like the style, size and color.....but it doesn't work right so it's like running with a flat tire...
I ordered this from the Amazon warehouse as a refurbished item. It was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together. The glue didn't  hold so the clamping base separated from the stem that allows the meter to swivel. This was unfixable so I sent it back for a refund. Warehouse deals are not such good deals.
Very accurate tuner BUT it broke within the first week I used it.  The little head on the tuner is connected with an arm and a ball and even when  you are gently the three prongs holding the ball joint can crack and break rendering it useless.  I will try to get a replacement... Now as a tuner it was really quite good but just not durable which is kinda what you need.
Like the other one star reviewers -- my problem is that the head broke off. I tried to glue it back on, but it just fell apart even worse when I tried to do that. If you buy this, you really need to baby it! My advice is look for a more sturdy model!
...what is the sound in the background of the hissssssssssssss? My guitar I guess, but who cares? I honestly bought this gizmo for the extremely good hisssssssssssssing nothing else.A question to AMAZON: Companies producing objects that are nothing else than a lemon shouldn't be prosecuted?P.S.I think it is "too polluting" for 'low cost' items to waste again in paper box, transportation, restocking work, refund work and so on. This is why 99% of the time I do not ask for my money back / BUT / sell this lemon on Amazon, online with other websites,  and in all the instrument shops worldwide in a total bad faith (while testing nobody in iRig noticed the overwhelming  hisssssssing?) well that is beyond me!
My review(s) for this have changed a few times, but no more. When I first got it I liked the sound, though it did sound a little cold and digital, and this is from someone wanting to record shoegaze/dreampop, which by it's nature is full of cold tones (reverb/chorus/delay) shimmering, a la cocteau twins, chapterhouse, lush, so at first I thought it was great. Then the fuse software was even cooler, all this customizing the sound, though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise away.After all of that I finally realized I was trying to ignore the fizz/crackle/hair, it's called a few things. Go to the fender forums and look it up, or search it on yahoo/google.The thing happening with this amp I think is a few things. Fender guitars sound best through it, which is silly if you don't own a fender, and I don't and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out, I wanted ANYTHING but a strat body, unless I have a grand to pay for an older one, I'm not going to get a rinky dink one, and I would only get one after I got like 5 other dream guitars first.so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality. Also, playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer, that may be fine for some (younger folks), but to a lot of people I've read the complaints I was trying not to realize, as I didn't feel like having to pay for shipping to return it, BUT I DID!And I am so glad I did. I almost got a peavey vypyr, and I am glad I didn't. This amp, to be fair, is really close to being really cool, but that sound problem, which I read on fender's own forum/website, FENDER ACKNOWLEDGES IT EXISTS, BUT DOES NOTHING TO FIX IT IN FUTURE MODELS!! sorry, but that's some big company b.s.I've been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that, and I was like "what music snobs" and what have you. But I realized that I'm a music snob! I love the music I listen to more than anything, and feel like the music I create should have a life to it as well. So I returned the mustang 2 and ALMOST got a marshall mg 30 watt, cause I wanted an amp with a clean sound that didn't have that crackle sound, but THANKFULLY I caught myself before that return, as after that, it would have been final.The decision I did make I think will be great for me, as I'd rather start with a good real tone, then get the effects I need. I kept reading reviews of these teenagers that hadn't played for more than a year or two or so saying "throw away your pedals, you won't need them" and "I was going to get pedals, but don't need to now", that's kind of the danger of these amps, they end up making everyone sound the same! No matter what tweaking I was doing on the mustang, it sounded the same but in a different costume.I think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and I've seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years, maybe that's for them, but I needed something to record with and practice and get the best, most real tone possible, so that means tube amp.I think if I played this at a GC I wouldn't of gotten it, and I just tried to make myself like it.
Works as advertised but the keys are stiff. Pads take too much presure to activate. Nice that I dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop.After the first few uses the USB socket broke and fell off into the unit rendering it useless. Wrote to dealer that was listed as selling it to me thru Amazon only to have them tell me the wrong seller was listed. I had registered it with AKAI already so I complained to them and they sent me a new one. I had to pay shipping back the old one to them even though it was a defective product.Not recommending this product.
This unit might be great if you have child hands - The KEYS ON THE  keyboard is soooo small..  Don't get this if you have Man hands! wtf U[DATE THE DESCRIPTION Akai WTF
A dull, inept version of a TubeScreamer. Just sounds flat and boring. Not very inspiring. At all. (Then again, I never did really like TS's).......
Really wanted to like this one, because I loved the price. There is no way this is true bypass. The one I got was defective out of the box, and so when I checked, I saw the circuitry did not support pass through.  Maybe it is because I received a defective one, but I still wouldn't try this brand name. I am now stuck saving up for a Full Tone or something.
I honestly don't see the purpose.  It doesn't seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar.  I've used it a few times, but don't see the benefit.Edit 5/30/13:After coming back to read the other reviews, it's obvious what happened:  This was shipped to me completely dry.  There was no grease/lubricant qualities.  It was like a dry erase pad.  They need to improve their quality control.  I'm changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star.  They HAVE to find a way to fully secure this gap or maybe consider enhanced vacuum sealing packaging.I would suggest if you receive this product and it hasn't dried out yet, to place this product in a air-tight ziplock bag to reduce the likelihood of this drying out.
The cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes. I don"t like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time I used it. The cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and I lost sound. This cable is complete garbage. Never again!
I purchased this amp locally and initially, I thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp; lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds. This was my first Fender amp as well.The presets were neat and all, but when I played around with some of the "standard" models (just the amp model, no effects) just to see how it's clean sound was, the amp just hissed as if I had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max. The master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on... I've never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it, even when there was no guitar plugged in... All I could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes; very distracting and it drove me nuts! This isn't a ground loop issue (my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond), it's clearly a defect with this product. Dirty pre-sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse, again, even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume. You'd think I was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil, but NOTHING was plugged in and all I get is staticy-hiss at LOW LEVELS. WTF?The next issue is the weird "fizz" sound, that was especially noticeable on the low e. After striking a string, instead of a clean note, there's a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that "surrounds" the note, and fades as the string stops moving. It almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored MP3 file at a low bit rate and frequency. Whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable.The weird thing is, neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in, or when this was connected to my computed via either USB or the line in... but I'm not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my PC or cans. I got the III instead of the II because of the power behind it and the touted 12" Celestion speaker.Read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar/amp related websites (there's a 65 page forum post on the Fender support site that is quite interesting) and you'll find that these amps are having issues. Apparently, the Mustang I and II don't have these issues, and the firmware update did NOTHING to correct my amp. Is this a hardware issue, software issue, speaker issue? There is speculation that the LCD screen (which is not present on the I or II) may be causing problems, but no one seems to know for sure and Fender doesn't seem to care...Definitely try this before you buy it. You may get an amp that doesn't have these problems, you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care; let your ears tell you what sounds good.This amp has a lot of potential for great sounds, and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps, but in my opinion, technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage. I am disappointed that Fender hasn't yet correct what ever is wrong (some folks claim that Fender reps say that know what is wrong, but I'm not taking that as a fact...), but they have acknowledged that there is "something" wrong.Whatever... I took this back after a few days of playing with it, trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success( the built-in noise gate helps a little, but sucks tone) and I picked up a 100 watt Marshall instead. Guess what? The clean channel has ZERO hum or buzz, even when cranked. How about that? Even when I engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels, there is minimal noise.I'll knock Fender for NOT correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it, but they do have some other nice amps that I'd like to try. But before I buy another Fender amp, I'll take it for a test drive and I suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds.
A great idea, but pure crap in terms of functionality.  if you don't have something heavy on the flat end, the rubber piece moves, and before you know it, your axe is on the ground.  I saw some pictures of putting a 12 ounce can on the flat part as a counterweight, but I'm not so hot with that idea, especially if the can is open.  The lip need to extend down longer, and *something* needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around.  If I had a permanent place to mount this, I'd gorilla glue it down, but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and I'll get an extra guitar stand instead.  Good idea, but it doesn't work.
allotoday went to the stores to TEST out the followingtascams...dr 05,  dr 07 mk2, and dr 40  and, for myself,ended up buying nothing...their differences for YOUR  ears...are....dr 05,  this is a good quality toy...NO line in...use its own mic, you will be ok  with this, for meetings, etc.NOT really that good for  music...can be done, but NOT as good..if you use ext mic...u wont be happy either...HIGH background HISS noise  relative to all 3.dr 07etc etc...only slightly better than 05...all else same...dr 40 was MUCH quieter in noise level...be it...in mic, ext mic or LINE inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars...this can be used to ( semi ) record music too.so, testing on their own mics...that last one was far far better than the first two...for those wantingLINE in...means only that dr 40...however,my tests involved  checking  sound QUALITY  of bit more seriousLIVE recordings...took output from our  zoom r 24 recorder  and  input that to the dr 40...upon comparing the resulting  CDs...a / mstr ed by the zoom r24 and print to cd,  vs...b / recorded dr40 and printed to cd...the sound was Obviously better  with  a /no need to buy  any  a/d recorder attempt at this price level ,if one is looking for semi serious  Master recorder...my budget must be tripled at least...and then to go out to test some more !no cheap way, is there....for those curious, the whole idea has come from wanting to connect  2 units of zoom r24,  NOT wanting to use computer software,  taking the 4 outputs from these two into a clean mixer or analog sum box,  and getting them downto  2 channels, and finallly to some mastering digital recorder....hoping perhaps the tascam ss r100 or r200 MIGHT do the trick,in the tests to come....many thanks, and may your camels always have two humps !k
Right out of the box, the low E string had a buzz and the intonation was WAY off (fretted E note on the 12th fret too sharp). After the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved. Next, I proceeded to adjust the intonation. I was able to get the intonation for the A, D, G, B, and high-E strings spot on. However, after bringing the saddle for the low E string as far back as it would go, the fretted E note on the 12th fret was still sharp.I also noticed that the bridge is slightly crooked (the low E string end of the bridge is closer to the neck than the high E string end of the bridge) - the bridge could have started out crooked or it could have shifted due to the high low-E string tension (loose bridge) -- which would definitely contribute to the defective low-E string intonation.I love the Red Burst design of this guitar (it looks absolutely WICKED). Unfortunately, I'm going to have to return it. I'm going to get a Squier Strat instead (with either aMapleorRosewoodneck).---[Update November 15, 2013]I ordered the Squier Strat direct from Amazon 6 weeks ago, but it was placed on backorder. I contacted Customer Service a week ago and was told me they wouldn't get it back in stock until December. Then, to my surprise, the Squier Strat was delivered yesterday! Yay!! :D The happiness!!I was able to get the Squier perfectly intonated. It's Red Burst like the Legacy (Fender calls it Antique Burst). It's a beautful guitar and and I'm loving it!
Just use a smartphone to record stuff. This is a really weird, not very intuitive little device that has been antiquated by the iphone and other smart phones. Not really worth the $75 - I returned mine.
Well... it's not really too expensive, but it give you basically the same sound no matter how you set it.  Even the crunch button is just a louder sound?  Not a very good value unless you try it out first and this is exactly the sound you're looking for.  Guess that's why it's so cheap.
This product is bad quality because the noise it makes. It increases the volume so much that it is better not to use it at all. I'm going to sell this product. I didn't like it.
DOWNGRADE TO 1-O STAR AFTER RETURNING IT BACK TO BROOKMAYS, THE SELLER:I am really disappointed by the seller, BrookMays', ignorant responses to my return of the defective Cherbub Guitar Pickup, which picks up unwanted noise by the wire's own movements and the high frequency of feedback that other pickup won't have the same issue.  After two weeks of the returned item was delivered, I didn't hear anything from the seller regarding the return, so I emailed to the seller to see if we can settle it asap.  Too bad, four days after the email had been sent, I only got the email of telling me the case# of the message I sent without any further response to my refund.  until my patience is gone to deal with this hassle, and I don't think it's worth to waste more time on it, despite the fact of wasting the time and money I spent on this useless pickup and the shipping costs. Therefore, yesterday, I emailed my last contact to the seller regarding the refund of the purchase and gonna report this to AMAZON about the bad after-sale service I ever have before if I still haven't heard from the seller shorty.Today, I finally received the seller's response to my refund, the seller denies the issues of the pickup and claims, "it was not defective. All pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar. The feedback can be to to many other issues. I have issued the refund of $7.04."  Obviously, the reply is unconvincing; although the feedback can be raised from varies issues, i have tried with another pickup to the same directions and setups, but it doesn't have such problems at all.  The fact is NOT ALL pickups get UNWANTED noise although I didn't try many pickups.  Cherub Guitar Pickup doesn't work as the product description to pickup the original tones of the instrument regardless the surrounding noises.  Moreover, the unwanted loud noise from its wire movements is really annoying, and there's no way to stop the wire movements while strumming. Indeed, I won't use it, and I don't want it to sit at my house as a useless property, so returning back to the seller may help to improve the issues it has.  However, the hassles I got from the seller is totally unexpected and it's NOT worth at all.By the way, I'm also unhappy about the refund of &7.04, I bought it for $8.79 along with AMAZON Free Shipping of the purchase of $25 or more.  To me, it is not the money of $1.75, but it's not fair to the buyer, who doesn't get the right service and quality from the purchase but only wastes the times and money on this matter. So if you really need a pickup for your instrument, I highly recommend you to spend few more dollars to get a much better and reliable one. Don't make the same mistake as I did to try this one because of the cheap price, in turn, you may get more hassles than you expect on such cheap merchandise.  I don't want that happens to anyone else, so I decided to tell you what I went through to keep you from the possible hassles before betting on it.2 STARS FOR THE 1ST REVIEW AFTER USING IT TWICE:I like the clip-on design, which is easy to use, so it is worth 2 stars; however, it doesn't work well clipping on small soundholed string instruments like ukes and kid size guitars because it touches the strings.  Besides that, it also picks up loudly through the wire's own movements, not as the description "regardless the surrounding noises."  I have distressed from those unwanted loud noises.  One more thing that it somehow produces much higher feedback to the mini amp that I use, and I have to turn the volume as low as possible to prevent the high frequency of feedback. However, when I switch to another pickup with the same setup on mini amp and acoustic guitars or uke. the amp doesn't have any feedback even turning it to almost the highest volume, and the other pickup doesn't have the unwanted noise from its own movement either.  I don't know whether is my lack of luck or the poor pickup I got ... I bought it because its cheap price (less than $9) & clip-on design, but, I can't accept the noises and I have to waste my shipping cost to return it back to the seller. So, if you want to give it a try, you may bear in mind that the seller, BrookMays, doesn't take any responsibility for the shipments even the item doesn't work properly as claimed description. Good Luck then!
I am a long-time musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments ... wanted to like this ... but ...First the positives:- Looks great- nice, easy to read display- the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs- the clip seems sturdy- tuner is compact- nice priceNow the significant disappointment:- inaccurateThe settings were on A-440 but every time I tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing, the tuning was sharp ... I tested this not only by ear but against other tuners ... very disappointing ... I have used the old Planet Waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price; however, since D'Addario now owns Planet Waves products, they have discontinued the tuner I like and only offer the NS Mini Tuner (it has its place I guess, but I much prefer the larger one ... too bad they made this decision IMO) ...I haven't settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now I will keep using my old Planet Waves models ...Bottom line, no matter how nice the Snark is in many ways, the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately, not only string to string but to a standard A-440 ... having failed that requirement, it is useless for me, especially in a band situation ...
I own the SN-8, which btw, is the best tuner I've ever used. I bought this bc it said it was made specifically for bass frequencies & violin. So I wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin. I was also intrigued by the &#34;tighter&#34; tuning aspect of the bars on this. Let me tell you, if it worked, the bars may have been a cool feature, but when you are fine-tuning an A string and it tells you you are on E (when you know you are on A bc the other tuners all say A, and it matches the piano), then there is a problem. I could not find any way to re-calibrate the thing, so it looks like it's just defective. The one I received was completely useless.I am amazed at the great SN-8...I am disappointed in this thing. I must have just received a dud (I hope, since these usually get good reviews), but I will be returning this since it absolutely does not work correctly. On the flip side, I will be getting another SN-8 in it's place, since I know those are great tuners & I love the one I already have.
Can't believe they are still selling these things at full price with the old 30 pin connector.  I have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector.  This is now a boat anchor.  To buy a 3 meter cable from them, they charge $40 for the cable, $15 to ship it and then tax.  The extortion here is almost Monster cable like.  These folks should be embarassed.
What was thought to be a DOA model, ended up being a mistake on my behalf. My iPhone 4S, which I have had for about a year now, must've had enough damage and wear to the dock connector so that it works fine...unless trying to use the JAM.In The Box: Comes with a simple instruction manual that has about three steps.It comes with the JAM and two cables (USB and IOS). It is bigger than I had imaginedIt's almost the length of an iPhone. Feels nice, and is very light. The cords aren't very long.
The velcro itself is insanely amazing. Its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing. If you have an alternative means to adhere this velcro to its surface with a strength stronger than 10 men, then by all means, use this stuff. In the end, you just can't make velcro this strong for use with a pedal board. Once together, it raises the height of the pedal very uncomfortably. I cannot think of a practical application for this velcro.
The HDE xlr to usb is ubs. I have the same problem the red blinking syndrome. I learneda long time ago dont try to fixsomething you paid for send it back. So I did Thanks Hde for wasting my time. Go sell your snake oil to someone else.....I
I sometimes see reviews as redundant and unnecessary and I see a lot of positive reviews for this guitar strap, but I don't know why. Maybe other people don't really care what kind of strap they have or maybe they just have never had a good strap before. It wasn't too hard to get on and only took a couple of seconds, but once I got it on it was stiff and felt odd. It was very uncomfortable around my neck and I took it off my guitar in a matter of matters. I would honestly recommend spending a few extra dollars on a more expensive and more comfortable strap. Unless you're just going for something that is inexpensive, does the job, and isn't designed for comfort.
I ordered 1 just to try it since it was so cheap, the first one arrived in non working condition, wires inside werent even soldered, so i ordered a replacement, plugged it in and it didnt work either, the second wasnt soldered either.I know its cheap, but i expected it to at least work, do not buy
It was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china.  Any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell.  If you can wait a month for delivery or longer, if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up.  If you have over a $500 guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too. I have decided to build my own
The device itself is difficult to read in bright light.My first one arrived not working at all.The second one arrived with a low battery. What? After three days the battery goes out.I would have returned it, but lost it because it doesn't adhere to the headstock very well. You've been warned.
50+ years playingmy pedal is unuseablethe lower strings are all mush at any gain or eq settingread all the good reviews and watched all the videosmine sounds nothing like themmaybe defectivei also own the joyo british and joyo crunch and they are flawless
Wow, the capture quality of the internal mics is so bad it almost makes me cry, but plug in some real mics and voila- the DR-40 becomes something special.... But, I do not always want to carry around so much equpment, and was hoping for better internal mics.Honestly, my super cheap Olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing.And WHY is the line-out so darn noisy!? Must be defective. Oh well... Gonna, have to send this back.
UPDATED 3/16/2014After owning the 2i2 for over a year and encountering many difficulties I am revising my once gleaming review.The 2i2 is a simple set-up. Pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs, connect a mic or (apparently) a "low-headroom" instrument to it, run the USB cable to your computer and set it up within the DAW described parameters. It would have been nice to know that the included Plug In Suite is not a stand-alone program, and that it functions in tandem with Ableton Live Lite and that it could be found it in the Plug-Ins section of Ableton, but I figured it out EVENTUALLY regardless. (Ableton itself is rather dodgy, and seems to crash constantly.) Sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely, so as no audio is being produced from my monitors!I wasn't sure for a very long time if this was USER ERROR, an Ableton problem, or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers, so after the gazillionth crash, I screamed "Ballsdogit!!!", and purchased a license for Reaper. After going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new DAW over the last few months, I began to realize that my monitors no longer "lock up", but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic!!!I had to tweak the living daylights out of Reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors. Now I'm in there and the FX do not work with the focusrite drivers. Garbage focusrite! Everyone I know that has Reaper raves about the plug-ins, and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface. I have yet to experience a crash, but I also have yet to experience any recording time.Seriously, I started reading on the Reaper Forums about problems encountered with the 2i2, and came across a response from David@focusrite actually saying that "you should not use this setup to record electric guitar..", and that if you need to record electric guitar you should "get something with more headroom like the 2i4." That is just unbelievable in my eyes!I'm sure I could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop, but why should I have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle? Besides that, I'll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers!This device is clearly marked for both XLR inputs and 1/4 instrument ins. There was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation, and I researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit. I feel lied to and disrespected as a customer, now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology. HOW IN THE HECK DOES THIS THING HAVE A NEARLY 5 STAR RATING!!!????The good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm. I have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 (when not crashing or locking up the monitors) seems to handle all of them well. I constantly check for driver updates, and have the latest drivers for the 2i2, but without a doubt the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products.Sorry focusrite, you dropped the ball here.
Hi Folks! OK, this thing is cheap. That's cool. But a cheap item you can't use is money thrown away. Before buying this I had read various reviews of some folks liking it and others saying it's too small. Well, I want to clear this up once and for all. IT IS TOO SMALL! Specifically, it is too short to reach across all six strings if you go past the third fret or so (depending on your guitar), AND it doesn't open wide enough to be able be slid down past the third fret, even on a skinny neck. This thing really is a puzzler. I mean, who the hell would make capos this size, especially when they could've made capos that actually fit for the same production price and sold them at the same price? Someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid. HOWEVER, a positive from this whole mess is that I finally found a capo to use with my ukulele, and for way cheap, ha ha. But if you are looking for a capo for a guitar of any size, this is utter garbage. Cheers!
I have had 2 of these tuners (you'd think I'd learn after one).  They calibrate okay , it's just that they tend to break where the swivel ball fits into the socket of the device (both of mine broke this way).  To me, for the price, it's made cheaply.  Try D'Addario instead; love their tuners.
The adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap, a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately.  Replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand.  They are light weight and if all you need is mic support in a fixed setting, good enuf okay I guess.  But after transporting and reset, I found them to be junk.
kripes man..the one time I go and actually buy a "honer" and its a "bummer" this thing has 3 keys off tune!! I can buy stuff 10 times better quality from Chinaand never have this kinda junk. Maybe it's a fluke because everyone else gave it a thumbs up and I 'm really not the type a guy to go running stuff down butmaaan Ive never got a harp this trashy B4!...... all i can say is buy Merana's for tryin out buy "suzuki" or Swan" from ebay/overseas if yer a poor guy like meand you'll be better off. Oh btw hot-tip for poor guys again--- you can get a "Mississipi River Harp" for only  $5.oo if you have a "Burke's" outlet near you!they're up by the counter and as good as the high dollar one made by unowho---- the Doctah has spoken! :)
This product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside.  Upon receiving mine and assembling it, it broke immediately while I was trying to mount an iPad onto it.  It also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability.  The metal parts of it seemed sturdy enough but the plastic parts looked and felt brittle.
This review is on the seller Yorozuya Yokoshima ,not the product. These people posted what seemed like a good price (not ridiculously low) on the Us Dream pedal. It was to be shipped from Japan. They then decided the price was an error and canelled my order. This kind of crap makes me wanna stop shopping on Amazon.com because the item was less than $4.00 under the next best posted price and these 3rd party sellers Yorozuya Yokoshima were afraid they wouldn't make a killing on the item. I am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior. I lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident.
Let me just start out by saying that I've been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time. I still own most of these units except for this one...the JoYo compressor. My setup is a very simple one...starting with a Stratocaster to compressor, wah-wah,  super-overdrive, boost pedal, delay, then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb & vibrato. I don't want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals I've tried over the years but I know why you want one and how to use them. This thing simply didn't work right out of the box. While the outside of this stomp box is all metal, the inside is full of very low grade parts from China. Loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board. I ended up sending it back for a full refund. I don't in anyway blame the seller. They took care of me without a hitch and I would buy from them again...just nothing with the name JoYo on it. If you're only buying these based on price I would say buyer beware...you get what you pay for.
It seems to do nothing as an effect and draws power reducing the volume on your instrument as well as the amp.  Not sure if it is just a broken pedal or if it is just junk. When received the package did not appear to be damaged, but I have tried it on 3 different amps and i get the same results regardless of the amp or the instrument.
UPDATE: received 6 of these. 5 are ok but one has a bad weld joint at the top retainer. It was held by only one small tac weld.I got what i paid for. cheap price and cheap product. no excuse to make this kind of low quality guitar stand, putting a $500 guitar on this is asking for guitar damage when the stand falls apart. not worth the time & $ to send it back to amazon. One star only for this product. Good chance that you will get a crappy one if you order this. Less than one star for this piece of ......
This is a cheap stand and I was not surprised to see it had broke less than 2 day after it had arrived. The top cup that holds the neck of your guitar was welded in one spot only and it was very thin metal where the weld was made. I do not recommend this product.
If you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static, non-oscillating, chorus like effect, it's fine for that.  As an actual pitch shifter though, this thing is awful.  All the pitch shift settings sound like they're 30 cents sharp. This is especially awful sounding when used as an Octave effect.  I suppose I could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but I did not want to void the warranty so I just returned it.  It's hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is.  I've read the same complaint about their Pure Octave pedal also. This is really too bad because all the other pedals for Mooer seem to be quite good.  I own their Reecho Delay pedal and quite like it and I'm also tempted to get their Green Mile pedal.If you're not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies, this pedal maybe fine for you but I doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory.One minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals.  It does not stick to the adhesive on ANY of the Velcro strips I've tried to use.
I got one of these from another source but have returned it for exchange because of the following issue:  when I record a track either with the "Audio Recorder" or "Guitar Amp" screens in Garageband on my iPad 3, iOS7, the recording is great. But once I toggle over to the multitrack view and attempt to play the recording just made, there is godawful distortion and the audio is completely unlistenable.  Here's the other part of this: I can use Apogee Jam guitar interface, and iRig Pre microphone interface and Garageband behaves as it should and I can play the multitrack view with no problems whatsoever. The Focusrite support folks suggested I do a backup of my iPad contents and then do a software restore but I opted to return the unit instead, since the Apogee and iRig both work perfectly with Garageband. So, I don't know if the unit is having a problem with iOS7 or I just happened to get a lemon but I'll find out when the new one comes next week.  If it works correctly, I'll update this review after doing a few recordings. But, I would say if you've just updated to iOS7 or are thinking about it and you want to get this unit, you might want to hold off on that upgrade.  UPDATE: Got a replacement unit and even did a restore on my iPad, as suggested by a Focusrite support tech, and STILL have the problem I discussed above.  So, this product simply has turned out to be a dud for me. If anyone else has a similar issue with this and find a resolution,  please let me know.
I have been using this gig bag for the past few months. If I do the math, I probably didn't use it more than 10 times, basically from home to the subway, from the subway to the studio and back, so maybe 20 minutes walk each time. So I used it for about 3 hrs and 20 minutes, mostly carrying it on my shoulders, sometimes by one of the two handles.Then the side handle started coming apart: the seam ripped on the side and the handle will eventually fall off if used. It will be OK for a while until the shoulder straps start breaking (which I kind of expect at this point!). Meanwhile I'm going to buy another (sturdier) gig bag.Save your money and get something better than this.
This thing is crap right out of the box it had holes in the stitching and all the pockets were sown on crooked. What can you expect for $20 tho. This was a temporary solution I don't recommend this for long term use it will probably fall apart.
Manufacturer's website claimed that this case would fit a Les Paul style guitar. I have an ESP Eclipse. Not even close. ChromaCast products are great. They need to fix the info on their web page. I'm not a fan of shaped Les Paul cases. Too bad.
Returned this item because the zipper was already broken when I received it. Not durable! Spend a few more dollars, it is worth it.
A great little package for the price, but unfortunately, the zipper failed the first time I tried zipping it up. I have a standard size acoustic guitar, but be aware, the fit was snug, but not tight.
straight out of the box this product reeked cheap. No directions inside or on the box. I messed with it for about 5 minutes. I would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic. I read the description but it did not say cheap. Live and learn.
Amazon and TC Electronics will not tell you that you need a 9V Power Supply. I didn't see any warning or advise in the Point of Purchase, nor in the package. This is an unfair practice from Amazon and TC Electronics.
Let me start by saying that this is a really cool pedal, and TONS of fun. I can see how this could make you a better player and i think it could also be used live.BUT (and this is a big but) this is my first "one star" review ever...My first "less-than-5-star-review" ever...same as others, switch failed less than ten days of owning it. used less than ten times total, light use at home, I wasn't even wearing shoes! By the way, a gigging/recording musician for over 25 years so i am not a youngster that misuses my stuff. Bummer too GREAT idea....poorly executed.I will not buy anther one. I will not recommend to other musicians.
I purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my Roland GR55 (which has a flawless basic looper built in, but only 20 seconds record and no undo). I had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that I wouldn't need to carry a power adapter along.The factory battery lasted about 1 hour. The second brand new fresh Duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes. I started recording a loop with another (3rd) fresh battery (tested 9.10 v with a multimeter) and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording, suggesting that it was faulty. The lights started coming on and off randomly (record/undo/all three together, then off, then undo on, then all three on etc. etc.)The first time I used the JamMan XT (with the factory battery) it seemed to be working OK and all I can say is that as a basic looper it sucked.I am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything, so I know it was not my poor technique. The main problem was that it didn't matter how hard I tried (even if I did a manual fade out) there was always a gap of about 2 seconds between the end of the loop and the start. This makes the unit useless.Also, it is poorly conceived in that, to replace the battery you have to take out 2 screws... exposing the delicate printed circuit board.The potential for damage here is very high. Also, replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board. To save a few dollars Digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible (read INEVITABLE) damage.I have owned quite a few Digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this one.It's going back to the store where I purchased it.
I really wanted to like these, but they're a frickin, lint-catching sticky frickin' mess! They went from my wife's snare back into the holder in a New York Minute, have never seen the light of day, and may have been thrown in the garbage. Save your money. We use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now.
