For   question   8 - 10 ,   complete   the   sentences   with   the   information   given   in   the   passage 。 Animals   on   the   Move It   looked   like   a   scene   from   “ Jaws ”   but   without   the   dramatic   music .   A   huge   shark   was   lowly   swimming   through   the   water ,   its   tail   swinging   back   and   forth   like   the   pendulum   of   a   clock 。 Suddenly   sensitive   nerve   ending   in   the   shark ’ s   skin   picked   up   vibrations   of   a   struggling   fish .   The   shark   was   immediately   transformed   into   a   deadly ,   efficient   machine   of   death .   With   muscles   taut ,   the   shark   knifed   through   the   water   at   a   rapid   speed .   In   a   flash   the   shark   caught   its   victim ,   a   large   fish ,   in   its   powerful   jaws .   Then ,   jerking   its   head   back   and   forth ,   the   shark   tore   huge   chunks   of   flesh   from   its   victim   and   swallowed   them .   Soon   the   action   was   over 。 Moving   to   Survive In   pursuing   its   prey ,   the   shark   demonstrated   in   a   dramatic   way   the   important   role   of   movement ,   or   locomotion ,   in   animals 。 Like   the   shark ,   most   animals   use   movement   to   find   food .   They   also   use   locomotion   to   escape   enemies ,   find   a   mate ,   and   explore   new   territories .   The   methods   of   locomotion   include   crawling ,   hopping ,   slithering ,   flying ,   swimming ,   or   walking 。 Humans   have   the   added   advantage   of   using   their   various   inventions   to   move   about   in   just   about   any   kind   of   environment .   Automobiles ,   rockets ,   and   submarines   transport   humans   from   deep   oceans   to   as   far   away   as   the   moon .   However ,   for   other   animals   movement   came   about   naturally   through   millions   of   years   of   evolution .   One   of   the   most   successful   examples   of   animal   locomotion   is   that   of   the   shark .   Its   ability   to   quickly   zero   in   on   its   prey   has   always   impressed   scientists .   But   it   took   a   detailed   study   by   Duke   University   marine   biologists   S .   A .   Wainwright ,   F .   Vosburgh ,   and   J .   H .   Hebrank   to   find   out   how   the   sharks   did   it .   In   their   study   the   scientists   observed   sharks   swimming   in   a   tank   at   Marine   land   in   Saint   Augustine ,   Fla .   Movies   were   taken   of   the   sharks ’   movements   and   analyzed .   Studies   were   also   made   of   shark   skin   and   muscle 。 Skin   Is   the   Key The   biologists   discovered   that   the   skin   of   the   shark   is   the   key   to   the   animal ’ s   high   efficiency   in   swimming   through   the   water .   The   skin   contains   many   fibers   that   crisscross   like   the   inside   of   a   belted   radial   tire .   The   fibers   are   called   collagen   fibers .   These   fibers   can   either   store   or   release   large   amounts   of   energy   depending   on   whether   the   fibers   are   relaxed   or   taut .   When   the   fibers   are   stretched ,   energy   is   stored   in   them   the   way   energy   is   stored   in   the   string   of   a   bow   when   pulled   tight .   When   the   energy   is   released ,   the   fibers   become   relaxed 。 The   Duke   University   biologists   have   found   that   the   greatest   stretching   occurs   where   the   shark   bends   its   body   while   swimming .   During   the   body ’ s   back   and   forth   motion ,   fibers   along   the   outside   part   of   the   bending   body   stretch   greatly .   Much   potential   energy   is   stored   in   the   fibers .   This   energy   is   released   when   the   shark ’ s   body   snaps   back   the   other   way 。 As   energy   is   alternately   stored   and   released   on   both   sides   of   the   animal ’ s   body ,   the   tail   whips   strongly   back   and   forth .   This   whip - like   action   propels   the   animal   through   the   water   like   a   living   bullet 。 Source   of   Energy What   causes   the   fibers   to   store   so   much   energy ?   In   finding   the   answer   the   Duke   University   scientists   learned   that   the   shark ’ s   similarity   to   a   belted   radial   tire   doesn ’ t   stop   with   the   skin .   Just   as   a   radial   tire   is   inflated   by   pressure ,   so ,   too ,   is   the   area   just   under   the   shark ’ s   collagen   “ radials ” .   Instead   of   air   pressure ,   however ,   the   pressure   in   the   shark   may   be   due   to   the   force   of   the   blood   pressing   on   the   collagen   fibers 。 When   the   shark   swims   slowly ,   the   pressure   on   the   fibers   is   relatively   low .   The   fibers   are   more   relaxed ,   and   the   shark   is   able   to   bend   its   body   at   sharp   angles .   The   animal   swims   this   way   when   looking   around   for   food   or   just   swimming .   However ,   when   the   shark   detects   an   important   food   source ,   some   fantastic   involuntary   changes   take   place 。 The   pressure   inside   the   animal   may   increase   by   10   times .   This   pressure   change   greatly   stretches   the   fibers ,   enabling   much   energy   to   be   stored 。 This   energy   is   then   transferred   to   the   tail ,   and   the   shark   is   off .   The   rest   of   the   story   is   predictable 。 Dolphin   Has   Speed   Record Another   fast   marine   animal   is   the   dolphin .   This   seagoing   mammal   has   been   clocked   at   speeds   of   32   kilometers   ( 20   miles )   an   hour .   Biologists   studying   the   dolphin   have   discovered   that ,   like   the   shark ,   the   animal ’ s   efficient   locomotion   can   be   traced   to   its   skin .   A   dolphin ’ s   skin   is   made   up   in   such   a   way   that   it   offers   very   little   resistance   to   the   water   flowing   over   it .   Normally   when   a   fish   or   other   object   moves   slowly   through   the   water ,   the   water   flows   smoothly   past   the   body .   This   smooth   flow   is   known   as   laminar   flow .   However ,   at   faster   speeds   the   water   becomes   more   turbulent   along   the   moving   fish .   This   turbulence   muses   friction   and   slows   the   fish   down 。 In   a   dolphin   the   skin   is   so   flexible   that   it   bends   and   yields   to   the   waviness   of   the   water 。 The   waves ,   in   effect ,   become   tucked   into   the   skin ’ s   folds .   This   allows   the   rest   of   the   water   to   move   smoothly   by   in   a   laminar   flow .   Where   other   animals   would   be   slowed   by   turbulent   water   at   rapid   speeds ,   the   dolphin   can   race   through   the   water   at   record   breaking   speeds 。 Other   Animals   Less   Efficient Not   all   animals   move   as   efficiently   as   sharks   and   dolphins .   Perhaps   the   greatest   loser   in   locomotion   efficiency   is   the   slug .   The   slug ,   which   looks   like   a   snail   without   a   shell ,   lays   down   a   slimy   trail   over   which   it   crawls .   It   uses   so   much   energy   producing   the   slimy   mucus   and   crawling   over   it   that   a   mouse   traveling   the   same   distance   uses   only   one   twelfth   as   much   energy 。 Scientists   say   that   because   of   the   slug ’ s   inefficient   use   of   energy ,   its   lifestyle   must   be   restricted .   That   is ,   the   animals   are   forced   to   confine   themselves   to   small   areas   for   obtaining   food   and   finding   proper   living   conditions .   Have   humans   ever   been   faced   with   this   kind   of   problem ? 1 . According   to   the   passage ,   a   shark   can   use   movement   to   do   something   except ______________ 。 ［ A ］ to   find   food ［ B ］ to   avoid   being   chased   by   its   enemies ［ C ］ to   find   a   new   place   to   live ［ D ］ to   show   its   braveness 2 . Examples   of   automobiles ,   rockets   and   submarines   are   used   to   show   that   _______________ 。 ［ A ］ humans   are   the   most   clever   living   creatures   in   the   world ［ B ］ human   inventions   enable   us   to   travel   in   almost   any   kind   of   environment ［ C ］ humans   are   very   successful   in   inventing   transportation   tools ［ D ］ humans   can ’ t   move   like   other   animals   in   any   circumstances 3 . What   is   the   key   to   the   shark ’ s   swift   locomotion   in   water ? ［ A ］ The   skin . ［ B ］ The   tail . ［ C ］ The   muscle . ［ D ］ The   jaw 。 4 . According   to   the   Duke   University   scientists ,   when   does   the   shark   stretch   its   collagen   fibers   to   the   greatest   extent ? ［ A ］ When   moving   its   tail   rapidly 。 ［ B ］ When   finding   its   preys 。 ［ C ］ When   staying   without   any   movement 。 ［ D ］ When   bending   its   body   in   swimming 。 5 . Why   is   the   area   just   under   the   shark ’ s   collagen   fibers   similar   to   a   belted   radial   tire ? ［ A ］ Because   it   is   also   full   of   blood   pressure 。 ［ B ］ Because   it   is   also   filled   of   air   pressure 。 ［ C ］ Because   it   is   also   inflated   by   pressure 。 ［ D ］ Because   it   also   can   be   used   again   and   again 。 6 . A   laminar   flow   is   formed   when   a   fish   swims ________________ 。 ［ A ］ slowly   through   the   water ［ B ］ rapidly   through   the   water ［ C ］ against   the   current ［ D ］ at   the   fastest   speed   in   water 7 . Consuming   the   equal   amount   of   energy   as   a   slug   does ,   a   mouse   can   travelas   long   as   it ______________ 。 ［ A ］ one   twelfth   times . ［ B ］ the   same . ［ C ］ 12   times . ［ D ］ 1.2   times 。 8 . A   shark   finds   its   prey   by ________________ 。 9 . According   to   the   passage ,   _______________ can   be   compared   to   the   string   of   a   bow   for   both   of   them   store   energy   when   stretched 。 10 . When   the   shark   detects   an   important   food   source ,   __________________________ take   place 。
