09 年 12 月 大学 英语六级 模拟 答案 部分 ( 新东方 ) Part   I   Writing   ( 写作 参考 范文 ) Living   in   College   Dormitories Many   students   are   obliged   to   share   accommodation   with   others   in   college .   Living   in   dormitories may   seem   awkward   at   first ,   but   it   may   prove   to   be   a   very   rewarding   experience .   In   this   essay ,   both benefits   and   disadvantages   will   be   discussed 。 If   you   have   never   shared   with   someone ,   you   may   have   some   difficulties   adjusting .   You   may   find others   very   different   in   character   and   habits   and   not   suit   you   as   companions .   For   some   people ,   the   lack of   privacy   is   the   biggest   challenge ,   while   others   may   find   their   roommates   over - sensitive   or   distant 。 Despite   the   problems ,   there   are   many   positive   aspects   to   sharing .   Since   new   students   are   often far   away   from   their   families   and   friends ,   they   may   experience   loneliness   and   homesickness ,   and   face new   challenges   in   their   studies .   Sharing   offers   companionship   to   students   who   might   otherwise   have to   face   these   problems   alone .   Furthermore ,   since   college   is   not   just   about   academic   learning ,   sharing is   an   opportunity   to   develop   communication   skills   and   abilities   to   deal   with   different   people .   Besides , roommates   can   learn   from   each   other   about   new   interests   and   explore   new   activities 。 In   conclusion ,   I   think   that   there   are   more   benefits   than   disadvantages   in   living   in   college   dormitories ,   but   it   depends   on   dealing   with   concerns   honestly   and   sensitively   in   order   to   make   student   life as   happy   as   possible 。 Part   II   Reading   Comprehension   ( Skimming   and   Scanning )   ( 15   minutes   ) 1 .
