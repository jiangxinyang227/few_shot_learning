大学 英语 四级 写作 优秀 范文 三篇 The   university ’ s   branch   campuses   in   suburban   areas In   recent   years   more   and   more   universities   have   built   up   their   branch   campuses   in   suburban   areas .   Now   it   is   very   difficult   to   find   a   university   without   a   branch   campus .   Maybe   no   one   can   tell   clearly   when   the   first   branch   campus   came   out 。 But   the   reasons   behind   this   phenomenon   are   obvious .   Among   these   reasons ,   the   enrollment   expansion   of   universities   plays   a   very   vital   role .   As   more   and   more   freshmen   are   remitted   to   universities ,   the   original   facilities ,   including   classrooms ,   apartments ,   dining   houses ,   laboratories   and   the   like ,   are   not   enough   any   more .   What ’ s   more ,   the   land   in   the   suburb   is   relatively   low   in   price ,   which   is   affordable   for   most   universities .   Besides ,   the   quiet   environment   in   suburban   areas   is   more   suitable   for   students   to   study 。 As   a   college   student ,   I   think ,   it   is   necessary   and   beneficial   for   many   universities   to   build   up   a   branch   campus .   However   the   building   of   branch   campuses   brings   some   problems .   For   one   thing ,   the   students   in   some   branch   campuses   cannot   enjoy   good   enough   facilities   and   the   teachers   due   to   limited   resources .   For   another   it   leads   to   less   direct   communications   among   teachers   and   students .   Therefore   the   university   should   take   a   full   account   before   it   decides   to   build   up   a   branch   campus 。
